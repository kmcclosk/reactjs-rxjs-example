# React/RxJS Example

Example of using RxJS as a state based router together with ReactJS. ReactJS is powerful because in the end it's all basic Javascript. This is in sharp contrast to the bizarre insanity of AngularJS. In ReactJS each component lives in it's own beautiful world, unentangled and without magic. It's sort of like the Actor model. Because of this similiarity, ReactJS pairs perfectly with RxJS which is a framework for creating, consuming and manipulating event streams. RxJS is like Promises, but generalized. If you appreciate the power of Promises, you'll go nuts for RxJS.

Example built on top of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS). This example draws on inspiration from [TodoMVC implementation with React and RxJS](https://github.com/fdecampredon/react-rxjs-todomvc).

This project requires [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to be installed. Once Browserify is installed, do the following:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies, then run Browserify to bundle the project sources files. Once this is done, you can view index.html.

If you want to play with this example and have the Browserify bundle created as you edit files, you can also install [Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify). Then you can run:

```
npm run watch
```
