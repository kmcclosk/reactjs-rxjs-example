# React/RxJS Example

Example built on top of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS). This example draws on inspiration from [TodoMVC implementation with React and RxJS](https://github.com/fdecampredon/react-rxjs-todomvc).

This project requires [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to be installed. Once Browserify is installed, do the following:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies, then run Browserify to bundle the project sources files. Once this is done, you can view index.html.

If you want to play with this example and have the Browserify bundle created as you edit files, you can also install [Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify). Then you can run:

```
npm run watch
```
